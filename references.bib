    abstract={First-order difference equations arise in many contexts in the biological, economic and social sciences. Such equations, even though simple and deterministic, can exhibit a surprising array of dynamical behaviour, from stable points, to a bifurcating hierarchy of stable cycles, to apparently random fluctuations. There are consequently many fascinating problems, some concerned with delicate mathematical aspects of the fine structure of the trajectories, and some concerned with the practical implications and applications. This is an interpretive review of them.},

    abstract={A large class of recursion relationsxn + 1 = $\lambda$f(xn) exhibiting infinite bifurcation is shown to possess a rich quantitative structure essentially independent of the recursion function. The functions considered all have a unique differentiable maximum{\$}{\$}{\backslash}bar x{\$}{\$}. With{\$}{\$}f({\backslash}bar x) - f(x) {\backslash}sim {\backslash}left| {\{}x - {\backslash}bar x{\}} {\backslash}right|^z (for{\backslash}left| {\{}x - {\backslash}bar x{\}} {\backslash}right|{\$}{\$}sufficiently small),z > 1, the universal details depend only uponz. In particular, the local structure of high-order stability sets is shown to approach universality, rescaling in successive bifurcations, asymptotically by the ratio$\alpha$ ($\alpha$ = 2.5029078750957... forz = 2). This structure is determined by a universal functiong*(x), where the 2nth iterate off,f(n), converges locally to$\alpha$−ng*($\alpha$nx) for largen. For the class off's considered, there exists a$\lambda$n such that a 2n-point stable limit cycle including{\$}{\$}{\backslash}bar x{\$}{\$}exists;$\lambda$∞ −$\lambda$n R{\textasciitilde}$\delta$−n ($\delta$ = 4.669201609103... forz = 2). The numbers$\alpha$ and$\delta$ have been computationally determined for a range ofz through their definitions, for a variety off's for eachz. We present a recursive mechanism that explains these results by determiningg* as the fixed-point (function) of a transformation on the class off's. At present our treatment is heuristic. In a sequel, an exact theory is formulated and specific problems of rigor isolated.},

 abstract = {The Feigenbaum constants arise in the theory of iteration of real functions. We calculate here to high precision the constants α and δ associated with period-doubling bifurcations for maps with a single maximum of order z, for 2 ≤ z ≤ 12. Multiple-precision floating-point techniques are used to find a solution of Feigenbaum's functional equation, and hence the constants.},
